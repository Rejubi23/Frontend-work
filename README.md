Frontend Work

## About This Repository
This repository documents my journey transitioning from a UX/UI designer to a frontend developer.

As a designer, I was used to handing off Figma files.  
As a frontend developer, I am learning to translate design into structure, logic, and real user interactions.

This repo focuses on:
- Component-based thinking
- UX-driven frontend development
- Clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Progressive Web3 onboarding (wallet connection first, Solidity later)

---

## Learning Philosophy
I am learning by building, not by memorizing.

Each update represents:
- A design decision
- A frontend implementation
- A documented learning milestone

---

## Progress Log

### Day 1 – Project Setup & First UI Component
**Focus:** Environment setup, Git/GitHub workflow, and basic UI

- Initialized frontend project structure
- Connected local project to GitHub
- Built first “Connect Wallet” button UI
- Implemented basic UI states (idle → connecting)

---

## What’s Next
- Improve wallet connection UX
- Handle loading and error states
- Integrate real wallet logic
- Connect frontend to smart contracts (next phase)
